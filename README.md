## Why? Wordle was so 2021

Because the world needed another Wordle clone, but with a twistâ€”or several. We've added features that will hopefully make your day. You're welcome.

## Miscellaneous features

Why settle for one way to torment yourself when you can have multiple? Choose from:

- **Normal Mode**: For the purists who like their Wordle straight up.
- **Inverted Mode**: More on this confusing delight below.
- **Speedrun Mode**: Think you're fast? Think again.

### Inverted

In this mode, we've taken the liberty of reversing the secret word. If the word was "bread," now it's "daerb." We hope you find this mode very enlightening.

Don't worry; the confusion doesn't stop there. We are proud to announce that the color feedback is also inverted:

- Wrong letters will light up in green.
- Correct letters in the correct position will light up in gray.
- Yellow remains yellow. Because.

### Speedrun

You have 60 seconds to guess the word. That's one minute to question all your life decisions that led you here. Meanwhile, enjoy a catchy tune because nobody gonna break my stride (audio may require you to click the screen because browsers are fun like that!)

## How to play

1. Select your preferred method of confusion
2. Start the self-inflicted challenge
3. Question reality
4. Press enter
5. Repeat
